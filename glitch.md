### ・Carry over Maxim's items ###

As a result of this glitch, you will have some of items Maxim's party had at the beginning of the game. It happens at the end of the prologue(after defeating Daos) if Maxim's party have more than 30 items. The program delete first 30 items(30 item slots) and leave some items from the 31th. A simple way to use this glitch is get 5 treasure boxs which contain stat-up potion and take off all equipments Maxim's party have before the battle with Daos), then you can carry over 6 items to 99 years after. In addition, you can obtain Might Sword and Hi-Potion from Hydra and Efreet. So with this 2 items, you could send 8 items to Hero, including Might Sword(it's the strongest Weapon). Moreover, when Hero's age starts,  you can duplicate these carry-over items up to 34 item slots for opening-closing camp menu.

Among many other items, these items below are really useful.

・Might Sword (ATP +380)

・Miracle (the amount is 87)


This glitch is absolutely effective and saves a lot of time.
For the beginning part, Hero's party can easily defeat the first few bosses at few hits.
For the middle to the end, you don't need to buy/pickup most of Equipments or Items.

### ・Hero's ATP UP 1 ###

This glitch increases Hero's ATP by the same point that the weapon Hero equips. It happens when Hero finds the Dual Blade at the fortress of doom in the sea, only if the item slot is filled(5 pages/60 slots). (Notice: you must not have the same weapon Hero equips in your item bag)

Not sure, but at the event, the program processes like this.

・take off Hero's weapon (but can't do that because items are full)

・calculate Hero's ATP (It causes a wrong calculation. base+weapon ATP will be base ATP.)

・force equip the Dual Blade on Hero (the weapon hero had will disappear)

・calculate Hero's ATP (this adds Dual Blade's ATP on Hero's ATP)

e.g.
> Before getting the Dual Blade.
> Hero's ATP: 500 (base: 250, weapon: 250)

> After got the Dual Blade.
> Hero's ATP: 800 (base: 500, weapon(Dual Blade): 300)

### ・Hero's ATP UP 2 ###

It's almost the same as ATP UP 1. but the place is right before the battle with the Sinistrals. If you sacrifice Might Sword for "ATP UP 1" and sacrifice Might Sword for "ATP UP 2" again, for some reason, Hero's ATP won't increase by 380. It will be 289 points.
